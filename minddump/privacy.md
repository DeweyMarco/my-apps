DropThought ("we", "our", or "us") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, disclose, and safeguard your information when you use our mobile application ("App"). Please read this Privacy Policy carefully. If you do not agree with the terms of this Privacy Policy, please do not access or use the App.

- **LocalAuthentication**: If you enable app lock (Premium feature), biometric authentication is handled entirely on your device using Apple's LocalAuthentication framework

## How We Use Your Information

## Data Storage

### Local Storage

Your journal entries, mood selections, and app preferences are stored locally on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework. This data remains on your device and is not transmitted to external servers unless you explicitly enable cloud backup.

### Cloud Backup (Premium Feature)

If you enable cloud backup, your journal entries are encrypted and stored securely in your iCloud account using Apple's iCloud infrastructure. This data is subject to Apple's iCloud Terms and Conditions and Privacy Policy. You can disable cloud backup at any time in the App settings.

### Data Retention

Your data is retained for as long as you use the App. You can delete all your data at any time using the "Reset All Data" feature in the App's Profile section.

## Data Sharing and Disclosure

We do not sell, trade, rent, or otherwise transfer your personal information to third parties. Your journal entries remain private and are never shared with advertisers, data brokers, or other third parties.

We may share anonymized, aggregated data that cannot be used to identify you personally for analytical purposes to improve the App.

### Service Providers

We use the following Apple services that may process your information:

- **Apple App Store**: Processes in-app purchase transactions
- **iCloud**: Stores your journal entries if you enable cloud backup (Premium feature)
- **Apple Analytics**: May collect anonymized usage data if you have not opted out

These services are subject to Apple's Privacy Policy and Terms of Service.

## Your Rights and Choices

You have the following rights regarding your personal information:

- **Access**: You can access all your journal entries and personal data stored in the App at any time
- **Export**: You can export your journal entries using the export feature in the App
- **Delete**: You can delete individual journal entries or all your data using the "Reset All Data" feature in the App's Profile section
- **Opt-Out**: You can opt out of analytics collection in your device settings
- **Disable Cloud Backup**: You can disable cloud backup at any time in the App settings
- **Cancel Subscription**: You can cancel your premium subscription at any time through your Apple ID account settings

## Security

We implement appropriate technical and organizational security measures to protect your personal information:

- **Encryption**: Your data is encrypted at rest using iOS security features
- **Local Storage**: Journal entries are stored securely on your device using Apple's SwiftData framework
- **Biometric Authentication**: App lock uses Apple's LocalAuthentication framework, which processes biometric data entirely on your device
- **iCloud Security**: If you enable cloud backup, your data is encrypted and stored using Apple's secure iCloud infrastructure

However, no method of transmission over the internet or electronic storage is 100% secure. While we strive to use commercially acceptable means to protect your information, we cannot guarantee absolute security.
