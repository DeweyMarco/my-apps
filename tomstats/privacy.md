# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated: January 23, 2026**

## Overview

Volleyball Stats ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information Collection

**We do not collect, store, or transmit any personal data to external servers.**

All data you enter into the App—including player names, jersey numbers, game information, and statistics—is stored locally on your device using a local database (SQLite). This data never leaves your device.

## Data Storage

- All app data is stored exclusively on your device
- Data is saved in a local SQLite database
- No cloud synchronization or backup services are used
- No data is transmitted over the internet

## Information We Do Not Collect

The App does not collect:

- Personal identification information
- Location data
- Device identifiers
- Usage analytics or tracking data
- Cookies or similar technologies
- Any data from third-party sources

## Third-Party Services

The App does not integrate with any third-party services that collect user data. There are no:

- Analytics platforms
- Advertising networks
- Social media integrations
- Cloud storage services

## Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, rent, or trade any user data with third parties because we do not have access to your data. All information remains on your device under your control.

## Data Retention and Deletion

Since all data is stored locally on your device:

- You have full control over your data at all times
- Uninstalling the App will permanently delete all associated data
- You can delete individual games, players, or statistics within the App at any time

## Children's Privacy

The App does not knowingly collect any personal information from children. Since no data is transmitted from the device, there is no risk of collecting children's data.

## Security

Your data is protected by your device's built-in security features. We recommend:

- Using a device passcode or biometric lock
- Keeping your device's operating system up to date
- Not sharing your device with untrusted individuals

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date at the top of this document. Continued use of the App after changes constitutes acceptance of the updated policy.

## Your Rights

Since we do not collect or store your data on external servers, traditional data rights requests (access, deletion, portability) are not applicable. You maintain complete control over all data stored locally on your device.
