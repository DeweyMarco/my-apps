## Overview

FitnessTracker ("the App") is committed to protecting your privacy. This Privacy Policy explains how we handle information when you use our mobile application.

## Information We Collect

**We do not collect any personal information.**

The App stores your exercise data (pushups, squats, and crunches counts) locally on your device only. This data:

- Never leaves your device
- Is not transmitted to any server
- Is not shared with any third parties
- Is not accessible to us or anyone else

## Data Storage

All data is stored locally on your device using on-device storage. If you delete the App, all stored data will be permanently deleted.

## Third-Party Services

The App does not use any third-party services, analytics, advertising, or tracking tools.

## Children's Privacy

The App does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age.

## Data Security

Since all data remains on your device and is never transmitted, your exercise data is as secure as your device itself.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. Any changes will be reflected in the "Last Updated" date above.
